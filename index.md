# General Website Demo

This repository now includes a GitHub Pages configuration that applies the `jekyll-theme-cayman` theme.

If you are looking for the interactive React experience, build the application (`npm run build`) and open the generated `dist/index.html` locally or host the `dist` folder as static assets.
